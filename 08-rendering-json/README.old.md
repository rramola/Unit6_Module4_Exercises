# Exercise 8: Rendering JSON

Most of the time, the structure of the data we're working with in real-world applications aren't simple lists like ['dog', 'cat', 'chicken', 'cow', 'sheep', 'horse'].

A lot of data is stored in JSON format. This is especially true when you're fetching data from a database.

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, a type of format for data interchange.

This type of data is just an object instead of a simpler datatype such as a string.

For example, an array of JSON objects looks like this:

[
{
id: 1,
setup: "What's the best thing about a Boolean?",
punchline: "Even if you're wrong, you're only off by a bit"
},
{
id: 2,
setup: "Why do programmers wear glasses?",
punchline: "Because they need to C#"
}
]

To keep it simple, let's keep it to only two items.

Using the array of objects above, render the jokes with React.

Tip:

Create a custom component for rendering each joke.
Using the map function, map through each object in the array. Use the custom component to render each object.
